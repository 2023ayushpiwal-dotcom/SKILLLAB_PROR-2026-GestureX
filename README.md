## 1.3 Project Title

`"Hand Gesture Recognition"`

## 1.4 One-Line Pitch

`An Raspi-powered system that understands hand gestures inspired by sign language and translates them into real-time digital communication.`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea

This project is an AI-based gesture communication system that allows a user to express common phrases like “hello,” “how are you,” or “thank you” using simple hand gestures. A camera connected to the system captures live video, and the software analyzes the hand movements and finger positions to recognize predefined gestures. Once a gesture is identified, the system converts it into a corresponding text message and displays it on the screen, effectively acting as a real-time translator from gestures to language.

The experience it creates is interactive and intuitive users can communicate without speaking or typing, simply by using natural hand movements. This makes the system feel responsive and intelligent, almost like it “understands” human gestures. The project uses a combination of hardware and software technologies, including a Raspberry Pi Camera Module for visual input, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe Hands to detect and interpret hand gestures in real time.

## 2.2 Original Twist

What makes our project special is that it doesn’t just detect gestures, it understands and interprets them like a communication system. Most existing projects either use simple sensors (like tilt = LED ON) or basic vision (just detecting a hand), but our system goes a step further by using AI to convert real hand gestures into meaningful phrases in real time. This makes it feel less like a demo and more like an actual human–computer interaction system.
Another key differentiator is the combination of intelligent software and practical hardware. By using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module along with advanced vision tools like MediaPipe Hands and OpenCV, our project performs real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition without needing heavy external systems. It creates a natural, touch-free way of communication that can be extended to accessibility applications, smart interfaces, or assistive technology making it both technically impressive and practically meaningful.

# 3. Project Intent

## 3.1 User Journey 

A user walks up to the system and powers on the Raspberry Pi. Within a few seconds, the camera feed appears on the screen, showing a live view from the Raspberry Pi Camera Module. The interface prompts the user to place their hand in front of the camera. As soon as the hand enters the frame, the system powered by MediaPipe Hands detects it and begins tracking the fingers in real time. The user raises an open hand, and the system instantly recognizes the gesture and displays “HELLO” on the screen. Curious, the user tries another gesture holding up two fingers and the system responds with “HOW ARE YOU.” Each action feels immediate, almost like the system is understanding them.

As the interaction continues, the user experiments with different gestures, watching the system respond with different phrases. When they make a fist, the message “I AM FINE” appears, followed by “THANK YOU” when they show a thumbs up. The experience becomes intuitive and engaging, requiring no physical contact just natural hand movements. By the end, the user realizes they’ve communicated multiple messages without speaking or typing, experiencing a seamless blend of AI and human expression through a simple, interactive interface.

# 4. Definition of Success

The project is successful if it can reliably detect and interpret predefined hand gestures in real time and convert them into correct text outputs with minimal delay. When a user performs a gesture in front of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, the system—powered by MediaPipe Hands should accurately recognize it and display the intended phrase within a second. Success also means the system runs smoothly on the Raspberry Pi without crashes, works under normal lighting conditions, and demonstrates consistent performance during live testing or presentation.

## 4.1 Definition of “Usable”

The system is considered usable if a new user can operate it without any prior training or technical knowledge. The interaction should feel natural, users simply place their hand in front of the camera and perform gestures without needing instructions every time. The gestures should be easy to perform, clearly distinguishable, and consistently recognized by the system. Additionally, the output (text on screen or LCD) should be clearly visible and understandable, ensuring that the overall experience is simple, intuitive, and frustration free.


## 4.2 Minimum Usable Version

What is the smallest version of this project that still delivers the core experience?


## 4.3 Stretch Features

Once our core system (gesture → text) is working, these are extra features that are nice to have but not essential for it to function:

Voice output (text-to-speech): Converting detected phrases into spoken audio so the system can “talk” as well as display text.
LCD display integration: Showing output on a compact external screen instead of just the monitor for a more embedded feel.
Data logging: Saving detected gestures and timestamps for analysis or demonstration purposes.

## 5.2 High-Level System Description

Explaination of how the system works can be shown in simple terms:

- Input (what the system receives):
 
  The system takes input through a camera. The Raspberry Pi Camera Module continuously captures live video of the user’s hand. This video acts as the raw input, showing different hand gestures and finger positions.
  
- Processing (what the system does with it):
 
  The captured video is sent to the Raspberry Pi, where software processes it. Using MediaPipe Hands, the system detects the hand and identifies key points on the fingers. Then, with the help of OpenCV, the program analyzes these points to determine which gesture is being shown. The code compares the detected gesture with predefined patterns and decides what it means (for example, open hand = “HELLO”).
  
- Output (what the system gives back):
  
  Once a gesture is recognized, the system displays the corresponding message on the screen. This could be shown on the monitor or an optional LCD display. For example, if the user shows a thumbs-up, the output might be “THANK YOU.”
  
- Physical structure (how it is built):

  Raspberry Pi (main processor), camera module connected to the Pi, optional components like LCD, LED, or buzzer. All components are connected directly to the Raspberry Pi, which acts as the central controller.

- App interaction if any:
  
  There is no separate mobile or web app required. The entire system runs locally on the Raspberry Pi using Python. The user interacts directly with the system by showing gestures in front of the camera, making it a touch-free and app-free interaction.

## 7.2 Wiring Plan

Describe the main electrical connections.

**sample Response:**  
`The RASPI is connected to the motor driver (L298N) using four GPIO pins (18,19; 22,23) to control motor direction (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4). Two PWM-capable pins (ENA and ENB; 25 and 26) are connected to control the speed of each motor.

The motors are connected to the output terminals of the motor driver. The motor driver is powered directly by the battery pack (higher voltage), while the ESP32 receives regulated 5V from the buck converter.

All components share a common ground to ensure stable operation. The projector and camera are connected to the laptop, which handles tracking and game logic separately.`

## 8.2 Software Logic/Algorithm

Describe what the code must do.

Include:

- startup behavior,
- input handling,
- sensor reading,
- decision logic,
- output behavior,
- communication logic,
- reset behavior.

**Response:**  
`

- **Sample Startup behavior:**  
  The Raspi/FPGA initializes motor pins, PWM control, and starts a WiFi access point with a web server. The laptop initializes camera input, tracking system, and projection mapping.
- **Input handling:**  
  Movement commands are received from the laptop (pygame sends http requests)
- **Sensor reading:**  
  The camera continuously captures frames, and OpenCV detects ArUco markers to determine the car’s position and orientation.
- **Decision logic:**  
  The system maps the car’s position into a virtual coordinate system and checks for nearby obstacles or collisions. If movement is valid, the command is allowed; if not, it is blocked or replaced with a feedback action (like a slight shake).
- **Output behavior:**  
  The ESP32 drives the motors using PWM signals to control speed and direction. The projector displays the updated game environment, including obstacles, targets, and feedback visuals.
- **Communication logic:**  
  The laptop sends HTTP requests (e.g., `/forward`, `/left`) to the ESP32 over WiFi. The ESP32 parses these commands and executes motor actions.
- **Reset behavior:**  
  If no command is received within a short timeout, the ESP32 stops the motors. The game resets when a level is completed or restarted.`

## 9.2 Material Justification

Explain why you selected your main materials and components.

**Response:**  
`DC motors (BO motors) were chosen instead of servos or steppers because the system requires continuous rotation for movement rather than precise angular control (Previously, we were considering using steppers as we were planning on tracking movement on the ESP using its relative position from an origin, but since we're using a camera now, this is not required). A motor driver (L298N) was used to allow bidirectional control and speed variation using PWM.`

# 15. Build Documentation

## 15.1 Fabrication Process(if any)

Describe how the project was physically made.

Include:

- cutting,
- 3D printing,
- assembly,
- fastening,
- wiring,
- finishing,
- revisions.

**Response:**  
`The fabrication process involved designing, manufacturing, assembling, and refining both the physical structure and electronic integration of the system.`

`Design (CAD Modeling):
The initial model was created using CAD software, where components were designed based on the actual dimensions of the electronic parts. This ensured accurate fitting and minimized errors during assembly.
Cutting (Laser Cutting):
The designed parts were fabricated using laser cutting techniques. Sheets were cut precisely according to the CAD model to create the structural base and mounts for components.`

`Components were fixed using adhesives and mechanical supports. Certain parts were intentionally kept modular (not permanently fixed) to allow easy replacement and modification of electronics.
Surface Finishing:
Some parts were sanded to smooth rough edges after cutting. Sawdust mixed with adhesive was used to fill gaps and uneven edges, improving structural finish. The final structure was then painted for better aesthetics and durability.`

`Environment Setup (Dark Room Fabrication):
To enhance projection visibility, a controlled dark environment was created using Z-boards, paper sheets, and bedsheets. This minimized external light interference and improved projection clarity.
Revisions and Iterations:
Multiple adjustments were made throughout the process, including refining alignment, improving structural stability, repositioning components, and optimizing the interaction between the physical car and projected environment.`
